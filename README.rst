How to contribute
-----------------

We go to great lengths to make it as easy as possible for people to run Open edX inside Docker containers. If you have an improvement idea, feel free to `open an issue on Github <https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker/issues/new>`_ so that we can discuss it. `Pull requests <https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker/pulls>`_ will be happily examined, too! However, we should be careful to keep the project lean and simple: both to use and to modify. Optional features should not make the user experience more complex. Instead, documentation on how to add the feature is preferred.
