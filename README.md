This is a one-click install of [Open edX](https://openedx.org), both for production and local development, inside docker containers. As a bonus, this also builds a mobile Android app for your platform.

## Getting started

    git clone https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker
    cd openedx-docker/
    make all

## That's it?

Yes :) When running `make all`, you will be asked some questions about the configuration of your Open edX platform. Then, all the components for a functional Open edX platform will be downloaded and assembled to and you will have both an LMS and a CMS running behind a web server on port 80, ready for production. You should be able to access your platform at the address you gave during the configuration phase.

All of this without touching your host environment! You don't even need root access.

To be honest, I really don't like 1-click installs :-p They tend to hide much of the important details. So I strongly recommend you read the more detailed instructions below to understand what is going on exactly and to troubleshoot potential issues. Also, instructions are given to setup a local development environment.

This might seem too simple to be true, but there's no magic -- just good packaging of already existing Open edX code. The code for building the Docker images is 100% available and fits in less than 1000 lines of code, in this repository.

## Optional features

Some optional features may be activated by defining `ACTIVATE_*` environment variables on the host. These features change configuration files (during the `configure` step) as well as make targets. For instance, to add SSL/TLS certificates, run:

    ACTIVATE_HTTPS=1 make all

### SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS access (`ACTIVATE_HTTPS`)

By activating this feature, a free SSL/TLS certificate from the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority will be created for your platform. With this feature, **your platform will no longer be accessible in HTTP**. Calls to http urls will be redirected to https url.

The following DNS records must exist and point to your server:

    LMS_HOST (e.g: myopenedx.com)
    preview.LMS_HOST (e.g: preview.myopenedx.com)
    CMS_HOST (e.g: studio.myopenedx.com)

Thus, **this feature will (probably) not work in development** because the DNS records will (probably) not point to your development machine.

To download the certificate manually, run:

    make https-certificate

To renew the certificate, run this command once per month:

    make https-certificate-renew

### Xqueue (`ACTIVATE_XQUEUE`)

[Xqueue](https://github.com/edx/xqueue) is for grading problems with external services. If you don't know what it is, you probably don't need it.

Note: in previous releases of openedx-docker, xqueue was run for all platforms. It is now an optional feature.

### Android app (beta)

The Android app for your platform can be easily built in just one command:

    make android

If all goes well, the debuggable APK for your platform should then be available in ./data/android. To obtain a release APK, you will need to obtain credentials from the app store and add them to `config/android/gradle.properties`. Then run:

    make android-release

Building the Android app for an Open edX platform is currently labeled as a **beta feature** because it was not fully tested yet. In particular, there is no easy mechanism for overriding the edX assets in the mobile app. This is still a work-in-progress.


## Requirements

The only prerequisite for running this is a working docker install. You will need both docker and docker-compose. Follow the instructions from the official documentation:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Note that the production web server container will bind to port 80, so if you already have a web server running (Apache or Nginx, for instance), you should stop it.

You should be able to run Open edX on any platform that supports Docker and Python, including Mac OS and Windows. For now, only Ubuntu 16.04 was tested but we have no reason to believe the install would not work on a different OS.

At a minimum, the server running the containers should have 4 Gb of RAM; otherwise, the deployment procedure will crash during migrations (see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section).

Also, the host running the containers should be a 64 bit platform. (images are not built for i386 systems)

## Step-by-step install

### Configure

    make configure

This is the only non-automatic step in the install process. You will be asked various questions about your Open edX platform and appropriate configuration files will be generated. If you would like to automate this step then you should run `make configure` interactively once. After that, you will have a `config.json` file at the root of the repository. Just upload it to wherever you want to run Open edX and then run `make configure SILENT=1` instead of `make configure`. All values from `config.json` will be automatically loaded.

### Download

    make update

You will need to download the docker images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/regis/openedx/). Depending on your bandwidth, this might take a long time. Minor image updates will be incremental, and thus much faster.

### Migrations and assets

    make migrate
    make assets

These commands should be run just once. They will create the required databases tables, apply database migrations and generate static assets, such as images, stylesheets and Javascript dependencies.

If migrations are stopped with a `Killed` message, this certainly means the docker containers don't have enough RAM. See the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### Running Open edX

    make up

This will launch the various docker containers required for your Open edX platform. The LMS and the Studio will then be reachable at the domain name you specified during the configuration step. You can also access them at [http://localhost](http://localhost) and [http://studio.localhost](http://studio.localhost).

## Additional commands

### Creating a new user with staff and admin rights

You will most certainly need to create a user to administer the platform. Just run:

    make create-staff-user USERNAME=yourusername EMAIL=user@email.com

You will asked to set the user password interactively.

### Importing the demo course

On a fresh install, your platform will not have a single course. To import the [Open edX demo course](https://github.com/edx/edx-demo-course ), run:

    make import-demo-course

### Daemonizing

Note that in production, you will probably want to daemonize the services. Instead of `make up`, run:

    make daemon

And then, to stop all services:

    make stop

### Logging

To view the logs from all containers use the [`docker-compose logs`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/) command:

    docker-compose logs -f

To view the logs from just one container, for instance the web server:

    docker-compose logs -f nginx

The last commands produce the logs since the creation of the containers, which can be a lot. Similar to a `tail -f`, you can run:

    docker-compose logs --tail=0 -f

### Debugging

Open a bash in the lms:

    docker-compose run lms bash

Open a python shell in the lms or the cms:

    make lms-shell
    make cms-shell

## For developers

In addition to running Open edX in production, you can use the docker containers for local development. This means you can hack on Open edX without setting up a Virtual Machine. Essentially, this replaces the devstack provided by edX.

(Note: containers are built on the Ginkgo release. If you are working on a different version of Open edX, you will have to rebuild the images with a different `EDX_PLATFORM_VERSION` argument. You may also want to change the `EDX_PLATFORM_REPOSITORY` argument to point to your own fork of edx-platform.)

### Standard devstack

Define development settings (on the host):

    export EDX_PLATFORM_SETTINGS=universal.development

Then open an LMS shell:

    make lms

You can then collect assets and run a local web server, as usual:

    paver update_assets lms --settings=universal.development
    ./manage.py lms runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

### Custom devstack

If you have one, you can point to a local version of [edx-platform](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/) on your host machine:

    export EDX_PLATFORM_PATH=/path/to/your/edx-platform

Note that you should use an absolute path here, not a relative path (e.g: `/path/to/edx-platform` and not `../edx-platform`).

Point to your settings file:

    export EDX_PLATFORM_SETTINGS=mysettings.py

In this example, you should have a `mysettings.py` file in `edx-platform/lms/envs` and `edx-platform/cms/envs`. Development settings file for docker are a bit different from stock devstack settings. For valid development settings files, check [`config/openedx/universal/lms/development.py`](https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker/blob/master/config/openedx/universal/lms/development.py) and [`config/openedx/universal/cms/development.py`](https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker/blob/master/config/openedx/universal/cms/development.py)

You are ready to go! Run:

    make lms

Or:

    make cms

This will open a shell in the LMS (or CMS) container. You can then run just any command you are used to. For example, install node requirements, collect assets and run a local server:

    npm install
    paver update_assets lms --settings=mysettings
    ./manage.py lms runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

## Maintainers

The images are built, tagged and uploaded to Docker Hub in one command:

    make dockerhub
  
## Troubleshooting

### Help! Your containers are eating all my RAM/CPU/CHEESE

You can identify which containers are consuming most resources by running:

    docker stats

### "Running migrations... Killed!"

The LMS and CMS containers require at least 4 GB RAM, in particular to run the Open edX SQL migrations. On Docker for Mac, by default, containers are allocated at most 2 GB of RAM. On Mac OS, if the `make all` command dies after displaying "Running migrations", you most probably need to increase the allocated RAM. [Follow these instructions from the official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced). 


### `Build failed running pavelib.servers.lms: Subprocess return code: 1`

    python manage.py lms --settings=development print_setting STATIC_ROOT 2>/dev/null
    ...
    Build failed running pavelib.servers.lms: Subprocess return code: 1`"

This might occur when you run a `paver` command. `/dev/null` eats the actual error, so you will have to run the command manually. Run `make lms` (or `make cms`) to open a bash session and then:

    python manage.py lms --settings=development print_setting STATIC_ROOT

Of course, you should replace `development` with your own settings. The error produced should help you better understand what is happening.

### `ValueError: Unable to configure handler 'local'`

    ValueError: Unable to configure handler 'local': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

This will occur if you try to run a development environment without patching the LOGGING configuration, as indicated in the [development](#for-developers) section above. Maybe you correctly patched the development settings, but they are not taken into account? For instance, you might have correctly defined the `EDX_PLATFORM_SETTINGS` environment variable, but `paver` uses the `devstack` settings (which does not patch the LOGGING variable). This is because calling `paver lms --settings=development` or `paver cms --settings=development` ignores the `--settings` argument. Yes, it might be considered an edx-platform bug... Instead, you should run the `update_assets` and `runserver` commands, as explained above.

### "`TypeError: get_logger_config() got an unexpected keyword argument 'debug'`"

This might occur when you try to run the latest version of `edx-platform`, and not a version close to `gingko.master`. It is no longer necessary to patch the `LOGGING` configuration in the latest `edx-platform` releases, as indicated in the [development](#for-developers) section above, so you should remove the call to `get_logger_config` altogether from your development settings.

## Disclaimers & Warnings

This project is the follow-up of my work on an [install from scratch of Open edX](https://github.com/regisb/openedx-install). It does not rely on any hack or complex deployment script. In particular, we do not use the Open edX [Ansible deployment playbooks](https://github.com/edx/configuration/). That means that the folks at edX.org are *not* responsible for troubleshooting issues of this project. Please don't bother Ned ;-)

Do you have a problem?

1. Carefully read the README, and in particular the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section
2. Search for your problem among [open and closed Github issues](https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)
3. If necessary, open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker/issues/new).


## Known missing features: discovery service, edX notes, ecommerce, notifier

Those extra services were considered low priority while developing this project. However, most of them should not be too hard to add to a standard install. If you need one or more of these services, feel free to let me know by opening an issue.

## Contributing

Pull requests will be happily examined! However, we should be careful to keep the project lean and simple: both to use and to modify. Optional features should not make the user experience more complex. Instead, documentation on how to add the feature is preferred.
