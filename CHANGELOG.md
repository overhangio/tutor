# Changelog

This file includes a history of past releases. Changes that were not yet added to a release are in the [changelog.d/](./changelog.d) folder.

<!--
⚠️ DO NOT ADD YOUR CHANGES TO THIS FILE! (unless you want to modify existing changelog entries in this file)
Changelog entries are managed by scriv. After you have made some changes to Tutor, create a changelog entry with:

    make changelog-entry

Edit and commit the newly-created file in changelog.d.

If you need to create a new release, create a separate commit just for that. It is important to respect these
instructions, because git commits are used to generate release notes:
  - Collect changelog entries with `make changelog`
  - The title of the commit should be the same as the CHANGELOG.md file section title: "vX.Y.Z (year-month-day)".
  - The commit message should be copy-pasted from the release section.
  - Have a look at other release commits for reference.

## v18.1.1 (2024-07-04)

- [Bugfix] Fix `mysql-native-password is not loaded` error in MySQL 8.4 when upgrading from tutor 15 or an earlier release to tutor 18 by enabling the plugin. (by @Danyal-Faheem)

<a id='changelog-18.1.0'></a>
## v18.1.0 (2024-06-25)

- 💥[Feature] Upgrade default charset and collation of mysql to "utf8mb4" and "utf8mb4_unicode_ci" respectively. This upgrade should be automatic for most users. However, if you are running a third-party MySQL (i.e. `RUN_MYSQL=false`), you are expected to upgrade manually. Please refer to the third-party provider's documentation for detailed upgrade instructions. Ensuring that your MySQL version is up-to-date is crucial for maintaining compatibility and security. (by @Danyal-Faheem)
- [Bugfix] Do not fail on start when there are not persistent volume claims to apply. (by @snglth)
- [Bugfix] Fix legacy warnings during Docker build. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-18.0.0'></a>
## v18.0.0 (2024-06-19)

- 💥[Feature] Upgrade to Redwood (by @dawoudsheraz)
- [Bugfix] Wrap Django5 warning imports in try-except block to avoid failures in django3 that's still in use in edx-platform's master branch (by @mariajgrimaldi).
- 💥[Feature] Pull translations via `atlas` during Docker build. This breaks the `openedx-i18n` custom locale Tutor feature in favor of [OEP-58](https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/concepts/oep58.html) in favor of <https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations>. (by @omarithawi)
- 💥[Feature] The `openedx-assets` command is replaced with `npm run` subcommands. This will slightly reduce the build time for edx-platform assets and comprehensive themes. It will also open up the door for more significant build time reductions in the future. Here is a migration guide, where each command is to be run in the `lms` or `cms` container:

  **Before**                               | **After**
  -----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `openedx-assets build --env=prod ARGS`   | `npm run build -- ARGS`
  `openedx-assets build --env=dev ARGS`    | `npm run build-dev -- ARGS`
  `openedx-assets common --env=prod ARGS`  | `npm run compile-sass -- --skip-themes ARGS`
  `openedx-assets common --env=dev ARGS`   | `npm run compile-sass-dev -- --skip-themes ARGS`
  `openedx-assets webpack --env=prod ARGS` | `npm run webpack -- ARGS`
  `openedx-assets webpack --env=dev ARGS`  | `npm run webpack-dev -- ARGS`
  `openedx-assets npm`                     | `npm run postinstall` (`npm clean-install` runs this automatically)
  `openedx-assets xmodule`                 | (no longer necessary)
  `openedx-assets collect ARGS`            | `./manage.py lms collectstatic --noinput ARGS && ./manage.py cms collectstatic ARGS`
  `openedx-assets watch-themes ARGS`       | `npm run watch-themes -- ARGS`

For more details, see the [deprecation notice for paver](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/issues/34467)
and the [static assets reference](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/open-release/redwood.master/docs/references/static-assets.rst)
in edx-platform.

- 💥[Feature] Update MongoDB to v7.0.7 (by @dawoudsheraz) MongoDB is upgraded from version 4.4 to 7.0. Since there have been major releases since 4.4, the upgrade will need to go through them before running Mongo 7. MongoDB would need to follow 4.4 --> 5.0 --> 6.0 --> 7.0 upgrade path to work correctly. The container will keep on restarting with featureCompatibility error if the upgrade path is not followed. To upgrade mongo, run the following command based in the appropriate environment:

    tutor <dev|local|k8s> upgrade --from=quince

For k8s only, the above command will not perform the upgrade automatically. Instead, the command will output a series of commands that would need to be run manually to carry out the upgrade.

- [Improvement] Upgrade Nodejs from 16.14.0 to 18.20.1 in edx-platform. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Auto-detect bind mounts of openedx-learning for edx-platform (by @bradenmacdonald)
- [Feature] Upgrade Open edX image to use Python 3.11 (by @dawoudsheraz)
- [Bugfix] Remove CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS setting from the LMS/Studio config template. This setting, which holds site-agnostic application logic, is now consistently set to a reasonable value upstream by LMS and CMS config. Using the upstream values fixes a bug where course import in Studio using the new Course Authoring MFE was broken in Tutor deployments because it required additional headers to be allowed (content-range and content-disposition) (by @ormsbee)
- [Improvement] Made Docker cache hits more frequent during the openedx image build via BuildKit's `COPY --link` feature (by @kdmccormick).
- 💥[Improvement] Upgrade MySQL to 8.4.0. The upgrade should be automatic for most users. However, if you are running a third-party MySQL (i.e., RUN_MYSQL=false), you are expected to upgrade manually. Please refer to the third-party provider's documentation for detailed upgrade instructions. Ensuring that your MySQL version is up-to-date is crucial for maintaining compatibility and security. (by @rohansaeed)
- 💥[Improvement] Ensure that the edx-platform repository git checkout is cached by Docker during image build. This means that the cache will automatically be cleared any time there is an upstream change. Thus, it is no longer necessary to run `tutor images build --no-cache` just to fetch the latest edx-platform changes. For this to work, any GitHub repository referenced by `EDX_PLATFORM_REPOSITORY` needs to end with ".git". Make sure that this is the case if you have modified the value of this setting in the past. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-17.0.6'></a>
## v17.0.6 (2024-06-13)

- [Feature] Introduces the IS_FILE_RENDERED Filter, which allows developers to specify files that should be copied directly without rendering. This update empowers developers to manage special file types, ensuring that they are transferred intact without undergoing template processing. (by @Abdul-Muqadim-Arbisoft)

- [Improvement]  Remove the obsolete `version` property from all Docker Compose files and remove the DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION config setting. This addresses the deprecation warning from docker-compose (version 1.27 and above) regarding `version` being obsolete. (by @jasonmokk)

- [Bugfix] Fix permissions error on windows when running `tutor dev start` (by @Danyal-Faheem)

<a id='changelog-17.0.5'></a>
## v17.0.5 (2024-05-22)

- [Feature] Introduces the CONFIG_USER Filter. Used to declare unique key:value pairs in config.yml that will be overwritten when running tutor config save. Useful for injecting secrets from an external secrets manager into edx, or other values that may change over time that you need to programmatically fetch. (by @abonnell)

- [Improvement] Add ability to patch proxy configuration for Caddy (by @ravikhetani)

- [Security] Add Upstream "Privilege re-escalation in Studio after staff access removed" git security patch in Open edX Image(by @dawoudsheraz)

<a id='changelog-17.0.4'></a>
## v17.0.4 (2024-04-09)

- [Security] Update Redis to 7.2.4 (by @dawoudsheraz)

- [Improvement] Update release to open-release/quince.3 (by @dawoudsheraz)

<a id='changelog-17.0.3'></a>
## v17.0.3 (2024-03-26)

- 💥[Bugfix] Prevent infinite growth of course structure cache in Redis. (by @regisb)
  - Redis is now configured with a maximum memory size of 4GB. If this is too low for your platform, you should increase this value using the new "redis-conf" patch.
  - Make sure that course structure cache keys have an actual timeout.
- [Feature] Introduce the "redis-conf" patch. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix merge conflicts in nightly when trying to apply patches from the master branch. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Ensure mounted installable packages are installed as expected upon initialization. (by @dawoudsheraz)

<a id='changelog-17.0.2'></a>
## v17.0.2 (2024-02-09)

- [Feature] Several enhancements to the Demo Course (by @kdmccormick):
  - The [Open edX Demo Course](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-demo-course) has been re-built from scratch with up-to-date instruction-focused content. Its directory structure has changed.
  - In order to support both the old and new structures of the Demo Course's repository, the command `tutor local do importdemocourse` will now auto-determine the course root based on the location of `course.xml`. Use the `--repo-dir` argument to override this behavior.
  - The new command `tutor local do importdemolibraries` will import any content libraries defined within the Demo Course repository. At the moment, that is just the "Respiratory System Question Bank", which is an optional but helpful extension to the new Demo Course.
  - To try out the new Demo Course now, run: `tutor local do importdemocourse --version master`.
  - To try out the demo Respiratory System Question Bank now, run: `tutor local do importdemolibraries --version master`.
  - To revert back to an older Demo Course version at any point, run: `tutor local do importdemocourse --version open-release/quince.2`, replacing `quince.2` with your preferred course version.
- [Bugfix] Remove duplicate volume declarations that cause `docker compose` v2.24.1 to fail.
- [Bugfix] Actually update the environment on `tutor plugins enable ...`. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Introduce a `tutor.hooks.lru_cache` decorator that is automatically cleared whenever a plugin is loaded or unloaded. This is useful, in particular when a plugin implements a costly function that depends on tutor hooks. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix compatibility with Python 3.12 by replacing pkg_resources with importlib_metadata and importlib_resources. (by @Danyal-Faheem)
- [Improvement] Upgrade base release to open-release/quince.2. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-17.0.1'></a>
## v17.0.1 (2024-01-25)

- [Bugfix] Error "'Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.RsaKey object' has no attribute 'dq'" during `tutor config save` was caused by outdated minimum version of the pycryptodome package. To resolve this issue, run `pip install --upgrade pycryptodome`. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] add `CONFIG_INTERACTIVE` action that allows tutor plugins to interact with the configuration at the time of the interactive questionnaire that happens during tutor local launch. (by @Alec4r).
- [Improvement] Add `.webp` and. `.otf` extensions to list of binary extensions to ignore when rendering templates.
- [Security] Fix JWT scopes in XBlock callbacks. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-17.0.0'></a>
## v17.0.0 (2023-12-09)

- 💥[Feature] Upgrade to Quince. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Feature] Replace "*.local.overhang.io" hostnames by "*.local.edly.io". (by @regisb)
- 💥[Feature] Enable the Indigo theme by default, if no other theme is set. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Deprecation] Tutor no longer supports the legacy Docker builder, which was previously available by setting `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` in the host environment. Going forward, Tutor will always use BuildKit (a.k.a. `docker buildx` in Docker v19-v22, or just `docker build` in Docker v23). This transition will improve build performance and should be seamless for Tutor users who are running a supported Docker version (by @kdmccormick).
- 💥[Deprecation] The template variable `is_buildkit_enabled`, which now always returns True, is deprecated. Plugin authors should assume BuildKit is enabled and remove the variable from their templates (by @kdmccormick).
- 💥[Deprecation] Adding Python packages to edx-platform via `private.txt` is no longer supported. Instead, users should bind-mount their requirement directories with `tutor mounts add ...`. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Updated how the Tutor setting `JWT_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY` is rendered into the LMS Django setting `JWT_AUTH['JWT_PRIVATE_SIGNING_JWK']` as required by a recent breaking upstream change. The new representation of the `JWT_PRIVATE_SIGNING_JWK` simply adds the `dq`, `dp`, and `qi` parameters. Without this fix, LMS would encounter an `InvalidKeyError` on all logins. (by @kdmccormick)
- [Improvement] You don't have to run `tutor config save` every time you enable or disable a plugin anymore. (by @CodeWithEmad)

<a id='changelog-16.1.8'></a>
## v16.1.8 (2023-12-10)

- [Feature] Make it easy to work on 3rd-party edx-platform Python packages with `tutor mounts add /path/to/my/package`. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] When configured with `RUN_MYSQL: true`, run `mysqld` with binlog expiry set to 3 days (rather than the default of 30).
- [Improvement] Fix `ulimits` error for elasticsearch in Docker rootless mode (by @OmarIthawi)
- [Improvement] Do not hardcode `OPENEDX_COMMON_VERSION = master` in the nightly branch. This removes git conflicts whenever we bump the common version in the master branch. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] The ``iter_mounts`` template function can now take multiple image names as argument. This should concern only very advanced users. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.1.7'></a>
## v16.1.7 (2023-11-17)

- [Feature] Upgrade to open-release/palm.4. It is strongly recommended to upgrade to this release for as long as possible before upgrading to Quince. Otherwise, many users will be logged out after the Quince upgrade and will have to log in again -- see the Quince release notes. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix installation of tutor due to missing dev.txt file in Python package. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.1.6'></a>
## v16.1.6 (2023-11-16)

- [Feature] Upgrade to open-release/palm.4. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Install tutor development tools with `pip install tutor[dev]`. (by @CodeWithEmad)

<a id='changelog-16.1.5'></a>
## v16.1.5 (2023-10-30)

- [Bugfix] Fix ORA2 file uploads in CMS. As the cache settings are shared between CMS and LMS, the settings are moved from `common_lms.py` to `common_all.py`. (by @FatemeKhodayari)

<a id='changelog-16.1.4'></a>
## v16.1.4 (2023-10-13)

- [Improvement] No more large dev images. This was fixed by adding `--no-log-init` option to useradd command and reducing space usage of `/var/log/faillog`. (by @CodeWithEmad)
- [Improvement] Upgrade the Open edX default version to open-release/palm.3. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.1.3'></a>
## v16.1.3 (2023-10-10)

- [Improvement] Adds `connect=False` to the LMS and CMS' MongoDB connection to prevent `ServerSelectionError` after a cluster failover. (by @open-craft)
- [Bugfix] Override `CMS_BASE` setting in Studio for the development environment. Without this, parts of Studio will try to use the devstack default of localhost:8010 instead. (by @ormsbee)
- [Bugfix] Fix build error caused by py2neo package that was abruptly pulled from pypi and GitHub. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.1.2'></a>
## v16.1.2 (2023-10-02)

- [Bugfix] Render config settings that are inside lists. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Correctly parse strings prefixed with pound "#" key in `tutor config save --set KEY=#value` commands. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] New action introduced: `CONFIG_LOADED`. This action is called whenever the config is loaded and makes it possible to verify the validity of configuration settings at runtime. (by @CodeWithEmad)
- [Bugfix] Fix file upload in open response assessments. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.1.1'></a>
## v16.1.1 (2023-08-29)

- 💥[Bugfix] Apply "fix mysql crash after upgrade to Palm" from 16.1.0 to `tutor k8s` deployments, as well. Users previously running `tutor k8s` with `RUN_MYSQL: true`, with any version between 16.0.0 and 16.1.0 including, might have to fix their data manually. For users running `tutor local`, this change has no effect, as the underlying issue was already fixed in 16.1.0. For users running `tutor k8s` with `RUN_MYSQL: false`, this change is also a no-op. (by @fghaas)

<a id='changelog-16.1.0'></a>
## v16.1.0 (2023-08-16)

- [Improvement] Improve support of legacy non-BuildKit mode: (by @regisb)
  - [Bugfix] Fix building of openedx Docker image.
  - [Improvement] Remove `--cache-from` build option.
  - [Improvement] Add a warning concerning the lack of support of the `--build-context` option.
- 💥[Bugfix] Fix mysql crash after upgrade to Palm. After an upgrade to Palm, the mysql client run by Django defaults to a utf8mb4 character set and collation, but the mysql server still runs with utf8mb3. This causes broken data during migration from Olive to Palm, and more generally when data is written to the database. To resolve this issue, we explicitely set the utf8mb3 charset and collation in the client. Users who were running Palm might have to fix their data manually. In the future we will upgrade the mysql server to utf8mb4. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] We upgrade to MySQL 8.1.0 to avoid having to restart the server after the upgrade.
- [Bugfix] Ask whether user wants to run locally during `tutor local launch`. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix a race condition that could prevent a newly provisioned Studio container from starting due to a FileExistsError when creating logs directory.

<a id='changelog-16.0.5'></a>
## v16.0.5 (2023-08-09)

- [Improvement] Upgrade the Open edX default version to open-release/palm.2. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.0.4'></a>
## v16.0.4 (2023-08-03)

- [Feature] Add support for HTTP/3, which considerably improves performance for Open edX. (by @regisb and @ghassanmas)
- [Bugfix] Do not display discussion units when the forum is not enabled. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Remove references to the wizard edition. (by @CodeWithEmad)

<a id='changelog-16.0.3'></a>
## v16.0.3 (2023-07-28)

- [Bugfix] Improve `tutor ... do settheme default` so that it reverts to the default theme rather than trying to switch to a nonexistent theme named "default". This will clear up some error noise from LMS/CMS logs. (by @kdmccormick)
- [Security] Fix content libraries creation by unprivileged users in studio (see [security advisory](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-3q74-3rfh-g37j)). (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.0.2'></a>
## v16.0.2 (2023-06-22)

- [Bugfix] On Kubernetes, fix mysql deployment by removing the `--ignore-db-dir` option, which no longer exists on MySQL 8. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.0.1'></a>
## v16.0.1 (2023-06-16)

- [Bugfix] Fix loading default Kubernetes config. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.0.0'></a>
## v16.0.0 (2023-06-14)
- 💥[Feature] Upgrade to Palm. (by @regisb)
    - [Bugfix] Rename ORA2 file upload folder from "SET-ME-PLEASE (ex. bucket-name)" to "openedxuploads". This has the effect of moving the corresponding folder from the `<tutor root>/data/lms/ora2` directory. MinIO users were not affected by this bug.
    - 💥[Improvement] During registration, the honor code and terms of service links are no longer visible by default. For most platforms, these links did not work anyway.
    - 💥[Deprecation] Halt support for Python 3.7. The binary release of Tutor is also no longer compatible with macOS 10.
    - 💥[Deprecation] Drop support for `docker-compose`, also known as Compose V1. The `docker compose` (no hyphen) plugin must be installed.
    - 💥[Refactor] We simplify the hooks API by getting rid of the `ContextTemplate`, `FilterTemplate` and `ActionTemplate` classes. As a consequences, the following changes occur:
        - `APP` was previously a ContextTemplate, and is now a dictionary of contexts indexed by name. Developers who implemented this context should replace `Contexts.APP(...)` by `Contexts.app(...)`.
        - Removed the `ENV_PATCH` filter, which was for internal use only anyway.
        - The `PLUGIN_LOADED` ActionTemplate is now an Action which takes a single argument. (the plugin name)
    - 💥[Refactor] We refactored the hooks API further by removing the static hook indexes and the hooks names. As a consequence, the syntactic sugar functions from the "filters" and "actions" modules were all removed: `get`, `add*`, `iterate*`, `apply*`, `do*`, etc.
    - 💥[Deprecation] The obsolete filters `COMMANDS_PRE_INIT` and `COMMANDS_INIT` have been removed. Plugin developers should instead use `CLI_DO_INIT_TASKS` (with suitable priorities).
    - 💥[Feature] The "openedx" Docker image is no longer built with docker-compose in development on `tutor dev start`. This used to be the case to make sure that it was always up-to-date, but it introduced a discrepancy in how images were build (`docker compose build` vs `docker build`). As a consequence:
        - The "openedx" Docker image in development can be built with `tutor images build openedx-dev`.
        - The `tutor dev/local start --skip-build` option is removed. It is replaced by opt-in `--build`.
    - [Improvement] The `IMAGES_BUILD` filter now supports relative paths as strings, and not just as tuple of strings.
    - [Improvement] Auto-complete the image names in the `images build/pull/push/printtag` commands.
    - [Deprecation] For local installations, Docker v20.10.15 and Compose v2.0.0 are now the minimum required versions.
    - [Bugfix] Make `tutor config printvalue ...` print actual yaml-formatted values, such as "true" and "null"
    - 💥[Improvement] MongoDb was upgraded to 4.4.
- 💥[Improvement] Deprecate the `RUN_LMS` and `RUN_CMS` tutor settings, which should be mostly unused. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Greatly simplify ownership of bind-mounted volumes with docker-compose. Instead of running one service per application, we run just a single "permissions" service. This change should be backward-compatible. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Add a `config save -a/--append -A/--remove` options to conveniently append and remove values to/from list entries. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Considerably accelerate building the "openedx" Docker image with `RUN --mount=type=cache`. This feature is only for Docker with BuildKit, so detection is performed at build-time. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Automatically pull Docker image cache from the remote registry. Again, this will considerably improve image build-time, particularly in "cold-start" scenarios, where the images need to be built from scratch. The registry cache can be disabled with the `tutor images build --no-registry-cache` option. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Automatically mount host folders *at build time*. This is a really important feature, as it allows us to transparently build images using local forks of remote repositories. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Deprecation] Remove the various `--mount` options. These options are replaced by persistent mounts, which are managed by the `tutor mounts` commands. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Add the `do importdemocourse --repo-dir=...` option, to import courses from subdirectories of git repositories. This allows us to import the openedx-test-course in Palm with: `tutor local do importdemocourse --repo=https://github.com/openedx/openedx-test-course --version=o
pen-release/palm.master --repo-dir=test-course/course`. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-15.3.7'></a>
## v15.3.7 (2023-06-13)

- [Bugfix] Change `authSource` to `authsource`(LOWERCASE) in mongo db parameters. This allow to authenticate with credentials in openedx code.(by @johanv26)
 - [Feature] Add support for loading in-cluster config when running inside a pod. In certain scenarios, Tutor may operate within a pod that has access to a cluster through role binding and a service account. In these instances, the ./kube/config file may not be present, but kubectl commands can still execute without any problems. (by @CodeWithEmad)
- [Improvement] Bump the default MongoDB Docker image reference from version 4.2.17 to 4.2.24. (by @fghaas)

<a id='changelog-15.3.6'></a>
## v15.3.6 (2023-05-22)

- [Feature] Upgrade to open-release/olive.4. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-15.3.5'></a>
## v15.3.5 (2023-04-28)

- [Feature] Make it possible to import the demo course from a different git repository or version. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Add a convenient `do print-edx-platform-setting` command to print the value of an edx-platform setting. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Improve edx-platform logging by silencing a couple deprecation warnings. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Add a convenient `do sqlshell` command to enter a SQL shell as root. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-15.3.4'></a>
## v15.3.4 (2023-04-13)

- [Feature] Upgrade to open-release/olive.3. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-15.3.3'></a>
## v15.3.3 (2023-03-22)

- [Improvement] Make it possible to extend or override the configuration of the uWSGI server. (by @MoisesGSalas)
- [Improvement] Running `tutor dev launch --mount=edx-platform` now performs all necessary setup for a local edx-platform development. This includes running setup.py, installing node modules, and building assets; previously, those steps had to be run explicitly after bind-mounting a local copy of edx-platform (by @kdmccormick).
- [Bugfix] Running jobs in development mode with `tutor dev do ...` will now correctly use the development image. Previously, it used the production image, just like `tutor local do ...`. (by @kdmccormick)
- [Improvement] Faster build with `npm clean-install` instead of `npm install` in the openedx Docker image. This may change the version of npm packages installed next to edx-platform. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Introduce the `DOCKER_BUILD_COMMAND` filter which makes it possible to customize the `docker build` command. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] During openedx image build, copy `dockerize` utility from Docker registry for better efficiency. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Better highlight enabled plugins in `tutor plugins list`. (by @regisb)

- [Bugfix] Make sure that v0 plugin patches are applied in the same order as plugins are listed. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-15.3.1'></a>
## v15.3.2 (2023-03-13)

- [Bugfix] Use supported YouTube API for transcripts imports. (by @mariajgrimaldi)
- [Feature] Add `tutor config patches list` CLI for listing available patches. (by @mafermazu)
- [Bugfix] Add the missing `UWSGI_WORKERS` env variables to the lms and cms k8s deployments. (by @MoisesGSalas)

<a id='changelog-15.3.1'></a>
## v15.3.1 (2023-02-28)

- [Bugfix] `patchStrategicMerge` can now be applied to jobs. (by @keithgg)

<a id='changelog-15.3.0'></a>
## v15.3.0 (2023-02-10)

- [Feature] Introduce plugin indexes, described in this [Tutor enhancement proposal](https://discuss.openedx.org/t/tutor-enhancement-proposal-tep-plugin-indices/8182). This new feature introduces a lot of new ``plugins`` commands. See the docs for more information. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Add the `plugins list --enabled` option. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Improvement] Modify the output of `plugins list`. Enabled plugins are indicated as "enabled". Installed but not enabled plugins are no longer indicated as "disabled" but as "installed".

- 💥[Feature] Simplify the hooks API. The modules `tutor.hooks.actions`, `tutor.hooks.filters`, and `tutor.hooks.contexts` are no longer part of the API. This change should not affect most developers, who only use the `Actions` and `Filters` classes (notice the plural) from `tutor.hooks`. (by @regisb)
    - Instead of `tutor.hooks.actions.get("some:action")`, use `tutor.hooks.Actions.SOME_ACTION`.
    - Instead of `tutor.hooks.filters.get("some:filter")`, use `tutor.hooks.Filters.SOME_FILTER`.
    - Instead of `tutor.hooks.actions.add("some:action")`, use `tutor.hooks.Actions.SOME_ACTION.add()`. The same applies to the `do` method.
    - Instead of `tutor.hooks.filters.add("some:filter")`, use `tutor.hooks.Filters.SOME_FILTER.add()`. The same applies to the `add_item`, `add_items`, `apply`, and `iterate` methods.
    - Instead of `tutor.hooks.contexts.enter`, use `tutor.core.hooks.contexts.enter`.

- [Improvement] Make it possible to override the max upload size in the LMS and the CMS. This is achieved by moving the "caddyfile-lms" and "caddyfile-cms" patches just before the `import proxy` declarations. We also wrap the `request_body` directives within `handle` statements, which means that the `max_body` sizes can be overridden for specific paths. (by @regisb)

- [Security] Fix grading issue in LTI consumer XBlock. See [security advisory](https://github.com/openedx/xblock-lti-consumer/security/advisories/GHSA-7j9p-67mm-5g87). (by @regisb)

- [Feature] Upgrade all Open edX services to open-release/olive.2. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-15.2.0'></a>
## v15.2.0 (2023-01-19)

- 💥[Bugfix] Fix "example.com" links in registration emails. This is a breaking change for platforms that have modified the "id" field of the LMS site object in the database. These platforms should set `SITE_ID=1` in the common settings via a plugin. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Running `tutor k8s upgrade --from=maple` won't apply and won't wait for the MySQL deployment to be ready if `RUN_MYSQL: false` (When you host your MySQL somewhere else like RDS) (by @CodeWithEmad)
- [Bugfix] Fix HTML component editing in studio by cherry-picking [upstream fix](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/31500). (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Changes annotations from `typing` to use built-in generic types from `__future__.annotations` (by @Carlos-Muniz)
- [Improvement] Resolve `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` warnings that pollute the LMS and CMS logs. As far as we know they were not causing any issue, apart from being a nuisance. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-15.1.0'></a>
## v15.1.0 (2022-12-13)

- [Improvement] Upgrade ipdb and ipython packages in the openedx development image. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Skip unnecessary image building in development. This should make `tutor dev launch` slightly faster. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix Authn MFE login in development by disabling enterprise integration. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix "Invalid value for ‘--from’" when running `tutor local upgrade --from=nutmeg`. If you are facing this error, just run `tutor local launch` and your platform should be automatically upgraded.
- [Bugfix] Fix "TypeError: Parameters to Generic[...] must all be type variables" error. This error may occur when upgrading from a very old installation of Tutor. It is due to an old version of the typing-extensions package.
- 💥[Deprecation] Get rid of the `quickstart` command. v15.0.0 introduced a deprecation warning, but we actually want users to stop using this command. Instead, use `launch` (by @regisb).
- [Improvement] Backfill persistent grades during upgrade from Nutmeg. If you observe missing grades after the upgrade from Nutmeg, run `tutor local upgrade --from=nutmeg`. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-15.0.0'></a>
## v15.0.0 (2022-12-06)

- 💥[Feature] Upgrade to Olive (by @regisb):
  - Mypy type checking options were modified: developers are encouraged to add the `--implicit-reexport` option to their IDE.
- [Bugfix] Update problem templates according newer python versions. (by @mariajgrimaldi)
- [Improvement] Add the `-h` help option to all commands and subcommands. Previously, we could only use `--help`, which is quite long for lazy fingers. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Feature] Add an extensible `local/dev/k8s do ...` command to trigger custom job commands. These commands are used to run a series of bash scripts in designated containers. Any plugin can add custom jobs thanks to the `CLI_DO_COMMANDS` filter. This causes the following breaking changes:
    - The "init", "createuser", "settheme", "importdemocourse" commands were all migrated to this new interface. For instance, `tutor local init` was replaced by `tutor local do init`.
    - Plugin developers are encouraged to replace calls to the `COMMANDS_INIT` and `COMMANDS_PRE_INIT` filters by `CLI_DO_INIT_TASKS`.
- [Feature] Implement hook filter priorities, which work like action priorities. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Improvement] Remove the `local/dev bindmount` commands, which have been marked as deprecated for some time. The `--mount` option should be used instead.
- 💥[Bugfix] Fix local installation requirements. Plugins that implemented the "openedx-dockerfile-post-python-requirements" patch and that needed access to the edx-platform repo will no longer work. Instead, these plugins should implement the "openedx-dockerfile-pre-assets" patch. This scenario should be very rare, though. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Improvement] Rename the implementation of tutor <mode> quickstart to tutor <mode> launch. (by @Carlos-Muniz)
- 💥[Improvement] Remove the implementation of tutor dev runserver. (by @Carlos-Muniz)
- [Bugfix] Fix MongoDB replica set connection error resulting from edx-platform's pymongo (3.10.1 -> 3.12.3) upgrade ([edx-platform#30569](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/30569)). (by @ormsbee)
- [Bugfix] Update ``celery`` invocations for lms-worker and cms-worker to be compatible with Celery 5 CLI.
- [Improvement] Point CMS at its config file using ``CMS_CFG`` environment variable instead of deprecated ``STUDIO_CFG``.

<a id='changelog-14.2.3'></a>
## v14.2.3 (2022-12-06)

- [Security] Fix rotation of JWT tokens for disabled users. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-14.2.2'></a>
## v14.2.2 (2022-11-29)

- [Bugfix] Fix `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: expected token 'end of statement block', got '|'` error by bumping the minimum required version of the Jinja2 package.

- [Feature] Add support for MongoDB SSL, authentication source, mechanism and replica set via the `MONGODB_USE_SSL`, `MONGODB_AUTH_MECHANISM`, `MONGODB_AUTH_SOURCE`, `MONGODB_REPLICA_SET` settings. (by @zakum1 and @regisb)

- [Bugfix] Fix tag of "openedx" development Docker image. Previously, this Docker tag did not include the Tutor version. As a consequence, a different cached image could be used in some cases. For instance: when running `tutor dev run` commands. Now, the image tag is "openedx-dev:TUTOR_VERSION".

- [Bugfix] Fix name of Swahili locale: it is "sw-ke" and not "sw" (by @regisb).

- [Security] Apply drag-n-drop v2 xblock [security patch](https://discuss.openedx.org/t/upcoming-security-release-xblock-drag-and-drop-v2/8768/7). (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-14.2.0'></a>
## v14.2.1 (2022-11-24)

- [Improvement] Auto-completion of `plugins` and `config` arguments: `plugins enable/disable NAME`, `plugins install PATH`, `config save --set KEY=VAL`, `config save --unset KEY`, `config printvalue KEY`. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix minimum click version (>= 8.0.0) when installing tutor from pip.
- [Improvement] Enable CORS by default for both LMS and CMS by moving those settings to the `common_all` partial. (by @arbrandes)

## v14.2.0 (2022-11-21)

- [Improvement] Auto-complete implicit `local/dev --mount /path/to/...` options. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Feature] Strong typing of action and filter hooks: this allows us to detect incorrect calls to `actions.add` or `filters.add` early. Strong typing forces us to break the `do` and `apply` API by removing the `context` named argument. Developers should replace `do(context=...)` by `do_from_context(..., )` (and similar for `apply`).

## v14.1.2 (2022-11-02)

- [Security] Fix edx-platform XSS vulnerability on "next" parameter. (by @regisb)

## v14.1.1 (2022-10-25)

- [Deprecation] Tutor is no longer compatible with Python 3.6. (by @regisb)
- [Security] Fix xblock ajax handler vulnerability. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Use web proxy gzip encoding to improve bandwidth. We observe a 75% size reduction on the LMS dashboard. (by @ghassanmas)

## v14.1.0 (2022-10-10)

- [Improvement] Upgrade Scorm XBlock to v14.0.0. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Improvement] The Richie plugin was transferred to the Openfun organization; thus, it is no longer officially supported and it is removed from the default set of plugins that ships with `pip install tutor[full]` or the Tutor pre-compiled binary. Users are encouraged to uninstall the `tutor-richie` Python package and install the `tutor-contrib-richie` package instead.
- [Feature] Upgrade edx-platform i18n strings to nutmeg.2. (by @regisb)

## v14.0.5 (2022-08-29)

- [Bugfix] Fix MongoDB replica set connection error resulting from edx-platform's pymongo (3.10.1 -> 3.12.3) upgrade ([edx-platform#30569](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/30569)). (by @ormsbee)
- [Feature] Upgrade all applications to open-release/nutmeg.2. (by @BbrSofiane)

## v14.0.4 (2022-07-29)

- [Feature] Add the `-m/--mount` option to `tutor dev quickstart`. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix `tutor dev start -m /path/to/frontend-app-learning` by introducing dev-specific `COMPOSE_DEV_TMP` and `COMPOSE_DEV_JOBS_TMP` filters (by @regisb).
- [Bugfix] Log the shell commands that Tutor executes more accurately. (by @kdmccormick)
- [Bugfix] `tutor dev quickstart` would fail under certain versions of docker-compose due to a bug in the logic that handled volume mounting. (by @kdmccormick)
- [Bugfix] The `tutor k8s start` command will succeed even when `k8s-override` and `kustomization-patches-strategic-merge` are not specified. (by @edazzocaisser)
- [BugFix] `kubectl wait` checks deployments instead of pods as it could hang indefinitely if there are extra pods in a broken state. (by @keithgg)

## v14.0.3 (2022-07-09)

- [Bugfix] Build openedx-dev Docker image even when the host user is root, for instance on Windows. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Patch nutmeg.1 release with [LTI 1.3 fix](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/30716). (by @ormsbee)
- [Improvement] Make it possible to override k8s resources in plugins using `k8s-override` patch. (by @foadlind)

## v14.0.2 (2022-06-27)

- [Bugfix] Update problem with hint template so it works with newer python versions. (by @mariajgrimaldi)
- [Feature] Add default PYTHONBREAKPOINT to openedx/Dockerfile (by @Carlos-Muniz)
- [Bugfix] Fix smtp server port in `cms.yml` which was causing email sending failures in the Studio. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Skip waiting for MongoDB if it is served using SRV records. (by @gabor-boros)
- [Improvement] Use `git am` instead of `cherry-pick` to simplify patching process.
- [Improvement] Tutor is now compatible with Docker Compose subcommand.

## v14.0.1 (2022-06-13)

- [Bugfix] Fix missing tables on migration from maple ([#689](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor/issues/689)). (by @ibrmora)

- 💥[Feature] Upgrade to Nutmeg: (by @regisb)
  - 💥[Feature] Hide a course from the `/course` search page in the LMS when the course visibility is set to "none" in the Studio. (thanks @ghassanmas!)
  - 💥[Improvement] The `lms.env.json` and `cms.env.json` files are moved to `lms.env.yml` and `cms.env.yml`. As a consequence, plugin developers must reformat the following patches to use YAML format, and not JSON: "common-env-features", "lms-env-features", "cms-env-features", "lms-env", "cms-env", "openedx-auth".
  - 💥[Feature] Persistent grades are now enabled by default.
  - [Bugfix] Remove edX references from bulk emails ([issue](https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/issues/100)).
  - [Improvement] For Tutor Nightly (and only Nightly), official plugins are now installed from their nightly branches on GitHub instead of a version range on PyPI. This will allow Nightly users to install all official plugins by running ``pip install -e ".[full]"``.
  - [Bugfix] Start MongoDB when running migrations, because a new data migration fails if MongoDB is not running

## v13.3.1 (2022-06-06)

- [Bugfix] Crashing celery workers in development (#681). (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix studio logout issue. (by @Alec4r)

## v13.3.0 (2022-06-03)

- [Security] Apply logout redirect url security fix. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Make it possible to force the rendering of a given template, even when the template path matches an ignore pattern. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Bugfix] Get rid of the `tutor config render` command, which is useless now that themes can be implemented as plugins. (by @regisb)

## v13.2.3 (2022-05-30)

- [Bugfix] Truncate site display name to 50 characters with a warning, fixing data too long error for long site names. (by @navinkarkera)
- [Feature] Add patch to allow overriding final openedx docker image CMD.
- [Bugfix] Ignore Python plugins that cannot be loaded. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Faster and more reliable builds with `npm clean-install` instead of `npm install`. (by @regisb. Thanks @ghassanmas!)
- [Bugfix] Fix 500 error during studio login. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix updates for the Caddy deployment in multi-node Kubernetes clusters (#660). Previously, Caddy configuration updates might fail if the Kubernetes cluster had more than one worker node. (by @fghaas)

## v13.2.2 (2022-05-06)

- [Bugfix] Mounts were broken in dev mode. (by @kdmccormick)

## v13.2.1 (2022-05-06)

- [Bugfix] Fix broken file upload in studio because of unpinned studio-frontend requirement (see [discussion](https://discuss.overhang.io/t/missing-js-css-files-missing-from-openedx-docker-image-in-studio/2629) and [pull request](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/30309)) (by @regisb. Thanks @uetuluk!).
- [Bugfix] "The Compose file is invalid" error on mounting dev-only folders. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] CMS settings in development. (by @regisb)

## v13.2.0 (2022-04-24)

- [Improvement] Add the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_STARTED` action and run `dev stop` on `local start` (and vice versa). (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Introduce `local/dev copyfrom` command to copy contents from a container. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Fix a race condition that could prevent a newly provisioned LMS container from starting due to a `FileExistsError` when creating data folders.
- [Deprecation] Mark `tutor dev runserver` as deprecated in favor of `tutor dev start`. Since `start` now supports bind-mounting and breakpoint debugging, `runserver` is redundant and will be removed in a future release. (by @kdmccormick)
- [Improvement] Allow breakpoint debugging when attached to a service via `tutor dev start SERVICE`. (by @kdmccormick)
- [Security] Apply rate limiting security fix (see [commit](https://github.com/overhangio/edx-platform/commit/b5723e416e628cac4fa84392ca13e1b72817674f)). (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Introduce the ``-m/--mount`` option in ``local`` and ``dev`` commands to auto-magically bind-mount folders from the host. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Add `tutor dev quickstart` command, which is similar to `tutor local quickstart`, except that it uses dev containers instead of local production ones and includes some other small differences for the convience of Open edX developers. This should remove some friction from the Open edX development setup process, which previously required that users provision using local producation containers (`tutor local quickstart`) but then stop them and switch to dev containers (`tutor local stop && tutor dev start -d`). (by @kdmccormick)
- 💥[Improvement] Make it possible to run `tutor k8s exec <command with multiple arguments>` (#636). As a consequence, it is no longer possible to run quoted commands: `tutor k8s exec "<some command>"`. Instead, you should remove the quotes: `tutor k8s exec <some command>`. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Deprecation] Drop support for the `TUTOR_EDX_PLATFORM_SETTINGS` environment variable. It is now recommended to create a plugin instead. (by @regisb)
- 💥[Improvement] Complete overhaul of the plugin extension mechanism. Tutor now has a hook-based Python API: actions can be triggered at different points of the application life cycle and data can be modified thanks to custom filters. The v0 plugin API is still supported, for backward compatibility, but plugin developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to the new API. See the new plugin tutorial for more information. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Improved the output of `tutor plugins list`. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Add `tutor [dev|local|k8s] status` command, which provides basic information about the platform's status. (by @kdmccormick)

## v13.1.11 (2022-04-12)

- [Security] Apply SAML security fix.
- [Improvement] In addition to the Docker build arguments `EDX_PLATFORM_REPOSITORY` and `NPM_REGISTRY`, also support two corresponding and identically-named `config.yml` values serving the same purpose.

## v13.1.10 (2022-04-11)

- [Feature] Upgrade all applications to open-release/maple.3.

## v13.1.9 (2022-04-06)

- [Security] Fix open redirect vulnerability in inactive user flow (see [commit](https://github.com/rgraber/edx-platform/commit/fbbcfe71832e700f16aad3636b0ccb35585d1c95))

## v13.1.3 (2022-02-01)

- [Security] Fix vulnerability in call to invalid enrollment API (see [commit](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/commit/a140c674799c527e961e37c5e46cb7dc1ffef5ac)).

- [Bugfix] During the upgrade, make sure that the environment is up-to-date before prompting to rebuild the custom images.
- [Bugfix] Fix ownership of MySQL data, in particular when upgrading a Kubernetes cluster to Maple.
- [Bugfix] Ensure that ``tutor k8s upgrade`` is run during ``tutor k8s quickstart``, when necessary.
- 💥[Bugfix] By default, detect the current version during ``tutor k8s/local upgrade``.

- [Bugfix] Missing requirements file in `pip install tutor[full]`.

## v13.0.0 (2021-12-20)

- 💥[Improvement] Upgrade to Maple
  - Install all official plugins as part of the `tutor[full]` package.
  - Don't print error messages about loading plugins during autocompletion.
  - Prompt for image building when upgrading from one release to the next.
  - 💥 Allow concurrent logins to the LMS and the CMS.
  - Add `tutor local start --skip-build` option to skip building Docker images.
- [Feature] Better support of Caddy as a load balancer in Kubernetes:
  - Make it possible to start/stop a selection of resources with ``tutor k8s start/stop [names...]``.
  - Make it easy to deploy an independent LoadBalancer by converting the caddy service to a ClusterIP when ``ENABLE_WEB_PROXY=false``.
  - Add a ``app.kubernetes.io/component: loadbalancer`` label to the LoadBalancer service.
  - Add ``app.kubernetes.io/name`` labels to all services.
  - Preserve the LoadBalancer service in ``tutor k8s stop`` commands.
  - Wait for the caddy deployment to be ready before running initialisation jobs.

- 💥[Improvement] Get rid of the "tutor-openedx" package, which is no longer supported.
- 💥[Improvement] Run all services as unprivileged containers, for better security. This has multiple consequences:
  - The "openedx-dev" image is now built with `tutor dev dc build lms`.
  - The "smtp" service now runs the "devture/exim-relay" Docker image, which is unprivileged. Also, the default SMTP port is now 8025.
- 💥[Feature] Get rid of the Nginx container and service, which is now replaced by Caddy. this has the following consequences:
    - Patches "nginx-cms", "nginx-lms", "nginx-extra", "local-docker-compose-nginx-aliases" are replaced by "caddyfile-cms", "caddyfile-lms", "caddyfile", " local-docker-compose-caddy-aliases".
    - Patches "k8s-deployments-nginx-volume-mounts", "k8s-deployments-nginx-volumes" were obsolete and are removed.
    - The `NGINX_HTTP_PORT` setting is renamed to `CADDY_HTTP_PORT`.
- [Bugfix] Fix building of the `openedx` image on ARM64 due to missing `libgeos-dev`

## v12.2.0 (2021-12-08)

- [Bugfix] Fix incorrect "from" address in course bulk emails (see [pull request](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/29001)).
- 💥[Improvement] Fail on incorrect image name argument in `images build/pull/push/printtag` commands.
- [Bugfix] Remove trailing slashes in docker-compose files for [compatibility with docker-compose v2 in WSL](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/8558).

- [Feature] Allow specifying extra pip packages through config.yml.

## v12.1.7 (2021-11-18)

- [Security] Timed exam security fix [29347](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/29347).

## v12.1.6 (2021-11-02)

- [Improvement] Upgrade all services to open-release/lilac.3.
- [Feature] Make it possible to override job configuration in development: if they exist, `dev/docker-compose.jobs.yml` and `dev/docker-compose.jobs.override.yml` will be loaded when running jobs.
- [Improvement] Faster `tutor local start` by building only necessary images.

        - The ``NGINX_HTTPS_PORT`` setting is deprecated.
    - Architectural changes:
        - Use Caddy as a web proxy for automated SSL/TLS certificate generation:
            - Nginx no longer listens to port 443 for HTTPS traffic.
            - The Caddy configuration file comes with a new ``caddyfile`` patch for much simpler SSL/TLS management.

            - Kubernetes deployment no longer requires setting up a custom Ingress resource or custom manager.
        - Gunicorn and Whitenoise are replaced with uwsgi: this increases bootstrap performance and makes it no longer necessary to mount media folders in the Nginx container.

    - Additional features:
        - Make it possible to disable all plugins at once with ``plugins disable all``.

    - Removed plugin `{{ patch (...) }}` statements:
        - "https-create", "k8s-ingress-rules", "k8s-ingress-tls-hosts": these are no longer necessary. Instead, declare your app in the "caddyfile" patch.
        - "local-docker-compose-nginx-volumes": this patch was primarily used to serve media assets. The recommended solution is now to serve assets with uwsgi.
