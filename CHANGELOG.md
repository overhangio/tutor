## v11.0.0 (2020-12-09)

- 💥[Improvement] Upgrade Open edX to Koa.
    - 💥 Setting changes:
        - The ``ACTIVATE_HTTPS`` setting was renamed to ``ENABLE_HTTPS``.
        - Other ``ACTIVATE_*`` variables were all renamed to ``RUN_*``.
        - The ``WEB_PROXY`` setting was removed and ``RUN_CADDY`` was added.
        - The ``NGINX_HTTPS_PORT`` setting is deprecated.
    - Architectural changes:
        - Use Caddy as a web proxy for automated SSL/TLS certificate generation:
            - Nginx no longer listens to port 443 for https traffic.
            - The Caddy configuration file comes with a new ``caddyfile`` patch for much simpler SSL/TLS management.
            - Configuration files for web proxies are no longer provided.
            - Kubernetes deployment no longer requires setting up a custom Ingress resource or custom manager.
        - Gunicorn and Whitenoise are replaced by uwsgi: this increases boostrap performance and makes it no longer necessary to mount media folders in the Nginx container.
        - Replace memcached and rabbitmq by redis.
    - Additional features:
        - Make it possible to disable all plugins at once with ``plugins disable all``.
        - Add ``tutor k8s wait`` command to wait for a pod to become ready.
        - Faster, more reliable static assets with local memory caching.
    - Deprecation: proxy files for Apache and Nginx are no longer provided out of the box.
    - Removed plugin `{{ patch (...) }}` statements:
        - "https-create", "k8s-ingress-rules", "k8s-ingress-tls-hosts": these are no longer necessary. Instead, declare your app in the "caddyfile" patch.
        - "local-docker-compose-nginx-volumes": this patch was primarily used to serve media assets. The recommended is now to serve assets with uwsgi.
