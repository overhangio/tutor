  This process should be automatic for most users. However, if you are running a third-party MySQL (i.e., RUN_MYSQL=false), you are expected to perform this process yourself. Please refer to the third-party provider's documentation for detailed instructions. Ensuring that your MySQL version is up-to-date is crucial for maintaining compatibility and security.
