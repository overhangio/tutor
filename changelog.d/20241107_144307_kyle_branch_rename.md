- ðŸ’¥[Improvement] Rename Tutor's two branches (by @kdmccormick):
  * Rename **master** to **release**, as this branch runs the latest official Open edX release.
  * Rename **nightly** to **main**, as this branch runs the Open edX master (a.k.a. main) branches, which are the basis fort the next Open edX release.
  * For Tutor Nightly users who do not set a TUTOR_ROOT, both the project root (`~/.local/share/tutor-nightly` on Linux) and the plugins root (`~/.local/share/tutor-nightly-plugins` on Linux) will be automatically renamed. (by @regisb)
