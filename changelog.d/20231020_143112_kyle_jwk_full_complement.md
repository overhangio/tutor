- [Bugfix] Updated how the Tutor setting ``JWT_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`` is rendered into the LMS Django setting ``JWT_AUTH['JWT_PRIVATE_SIGNING_JWK']`` as required by a recent breaking upstream change. The new representation of the ``JWT_PRIVATE_SIGNING_JWK`` simply adds the ``dq``, ``dp``, and ``qi`` parameters. Without this fix, LMS would encounter an ``InvalidKeyError`` on all logins (by @kdmccormick).
