- ðŸ’¥[Bugfix] Fix mysql crash after upgrade to Palm. After an upgrade to Palm, the mysql client run by Django defaults to a utf8mb4 character set and collation, but the mysql server still runs with utf8mb3. This causes broken data during migration from Olive to Palm, and more generally when data is written to the database. To resolve this issue, we explicitely set the utf8mb3 charset and collation in the client. Users who were running Palm might have to fix their data manually. In the future we will upgrade the mysql server to utf8mb4. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] We upgrade to MySQL 8.1.0 to avoid having to restart the server after the upgrade.
