- ðŸ’¥ [Feature] `tutor local do importdemocourse` will now import the new [Open edX Demo Course](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-demo-course), which has been rebuilt from scratch, as well as its new accompanying Demo Content Library. If you wish to import the old demo course instead (which no longer receives updates), you can run: `tutor local do importdemocourse --repo-dir . --version open-release/palm.4`.
