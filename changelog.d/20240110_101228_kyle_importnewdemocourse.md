- ðŸ’¥ [Feature] `tutor local do importdemocourse` will now import the new [Open edX Demo Course](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-demo-course), which has been rebuilt from scratch. If you wish to import the old demo course instead (which no longer receives updates), you can run: `tutor local do importdemocourse --repo-dir . --version open-release/palm.4`.
- [Feature] The new command `tutor local do importdemolibrary` will import a Demo Content Library, which is an optional but helpful extension to the Open edX Demo Course.
