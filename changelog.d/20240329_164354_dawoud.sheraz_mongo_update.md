- ðŸ’¥[Feature] Update MongoDB to v7.0.7 (by @dawoudsheraz)

  MongoDB is updating from 4.4 to 7. Since there have been major releases since 4.4, the upgrade would need to go through them before running Mongo 7. Mongo would need to follow 4.4 --> 5.0 --> 6.0 --> 7.0 upgrade path to work correctly.
  The container will keep on restarting with featureCompatibility error if the upgrade path is not followed. 

  To upgrade mongo, run the following command based in the appropriate environment:
  ```
  tutor <dev|local|k8s> upgrade --from=quince
  ``` 
  For k8s only, the above command will not perform the upgrade automatically. Instead, the command will output a series of commands that would need to be run manually to carry out the upgrade.
