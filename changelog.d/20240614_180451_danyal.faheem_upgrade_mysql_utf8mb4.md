- ðŸ’¥[Feature] Upgrade default charset and collation of mysql to utf8mb4 and utf8mb4_unicode_ci respectively (by @Danyal-Faheem)
    This upgrade should be automatic for most users. However, if you are running a third-party MySQL (i.e., RUN_MYSQL=false), you are expected to upgrade manually. Please refer to the third-party provider's documentation for detailed upgrade instructions. Ensuring that your MySQL version is up-to-date is crucial for maintaining compatibility and security.
