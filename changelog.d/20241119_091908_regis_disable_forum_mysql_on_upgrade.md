- [Feature] With the new forum v2 application, users have a choice to use MongoDB or MySQL as a storage backend, course per course. New users will automatically start using MySQL, while existing users will be responsible for migrating their data themselves (before the Teak release). Upgrade instructions are available here: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-forum/#installation. (by @regisb)
