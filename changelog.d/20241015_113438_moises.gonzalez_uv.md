- [Improvement] Use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as a replacement for
  pip for installing and resolving packages. uv provides a faster package
  resolution and installation steps, reducing the python-requirements layer
  build time by about ~2-5x.

  For the most part uv is a drop-in replacement for main pip functionality with
  the exception of VCS editable requirements. The main use of VCS editable
  requirements is to copy all the files in the VCS repository when installing
  the package. This can be avoided by making proper use of a `MANIFEST.in` file.
  It's possible to also use the `PIP_COMMAND=pip` build argument to keep using
  pip.
