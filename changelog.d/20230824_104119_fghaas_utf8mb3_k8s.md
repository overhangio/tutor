- ðŸ’¥[Bugfix] Apply "fix mysql crash after upgrade to Palm" from 16.1.0 to `tutor k8s` deployments, as well. Users previously running `tutor k8s` with `RUN_MYSQL: true`, with any version between 16.0.0 and 16.1.0 including, might have to fix their data manually. For users running `tutor local`, this change has no effect, as the underlying issue was already fixed in 16.1.0. For users running `tutor k8s` with `RUN_MYSQL: false`, this change is also a no-op.
