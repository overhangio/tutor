- ðŸ’¥[Feature] Replace Elasticsearch by Meilisearch. Elasticsearch was both a source of complexity and high resource usage. With this change, we no longer run Elasticsearch to perform common search queries across Open edX. This includes: course discovery, courseware search and studio search. Instead, we index all these documents in a Meilisearch instance, which is much more lightweight in terms of memory consumption. (by @regisb)
