- [Bugfix] Remove CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS setting from the LMS/Studio config template. This setting, which holds site-agnostic application logic, is now consistently set to a reasonable value upstream by LMS and CMS config. Using the upstream values fixes a bug where course import in Studio using the new Course Authoring MFE was broken in Tutor deployments because it required additional headers to be allowed (content-range and content-disposition) (by @ormsbee)
