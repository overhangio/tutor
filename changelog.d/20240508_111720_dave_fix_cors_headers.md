- [Bugfix] Remove CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS setting from the LMS/Studio config template. This is set separately by LMS and Studio config files in edx-platform and should not be overridden by Tutor, since the header types to allow is application logic and will not vary between sites. This fixes a bug where course import in Studio using the new Course Authoring MFE was broken in Tutor deployments because it required additional headers to be allowed (content-range and content-disposition). This had been set correctly in edx-platform, but was being overridden by Tutor. (by @ormsbee)
