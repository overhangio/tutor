- [Feature] Create a new /data/openedx-media-private volume to store media files that are not publicly accessible via the browser, and create configuration that Learning Core (openedx-learning) will use to access this storage space. Learning Core will use a sub-directory of /data/openedx-media-private to store Content Library file uploads, but other apps can create their own sub-directories for their own use. (by @ormsbee)
