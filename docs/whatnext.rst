What next?
==========

You have gone through the :ref:`Quickstart installation <quickstart>`: at this point you should have a running Open edX platform. If you don't, please follow the instructions from the :ref:`Troubleshooting <troubleshooting>` section.

Logging-in as administrator
---------------------------

Out of the box, Tutor does not create any user for you. You will want to create a user yourself with staff and administrator privileges in order to access the studio. There is a :ref:`simple command for that <createuser>`.

Importing a demo course
-----------------------

To get a glimpse of the possibilities of Open edX, we recommend you import the `official demo test course <https://github.com/openedx/demo-test-course>`__. Tutor provides a :ref:`simple command for that <democourse>`.

Making Open edX look better
---------------------------

Tutor makes it easy to :ref:`install <theming>` and :ref:`develop <theme_development>` your own themes. We also provide `Indigo <https://github.com/overhangio/indigo>`__: a free, customizable theme that you can install today.

Adding features

Hacking into Open edX
