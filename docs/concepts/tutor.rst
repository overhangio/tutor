It uses the original code from the various Open edX repositories, such as `edx-platform <https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/>`_, `cs_comments_service <https://github.com/openedx/cs_comments_service>`_, etc. and packages everything in a way that makes it very easy to install, administer and upgrade Open edX. In particular, all services are run inside Docker containers.

Tutor makes it possible to deploy Open edX locally, with `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/>`_ or on an existing `Kubernetes cluster <http://kubernetes.io/>`_.
