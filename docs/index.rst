Disclaimers & Warnings
----------------------

This project is the follow-up of my work on an `install from scratch of Open edX <https://github.com/regisb/openedx-install>`_. It does not rely on any hack or complex deployment script. In particular, we do not use the Open edX `Ansible deployment playbooks <https://github.com/edx/configuration/>`_. That means that the folks at edX.org are *not* responsible for troubleshooting issues of this project. Please don't bother Ned ;-)

In case of trouble, please follow the instructions in the :ref:`troubleshooting` section.

Contributing
------------

We go to great lengths to make it as easy as possible for people to run Open edX inside Docker containers. If you have an improvement idea, feel free to `open an issue on Github <https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker/issues/new>`_ so that we can discuss it. `Pull requests <https://github.com/regisb/openedx-docker/pulls>`_ will be happily examined, too! However, we should be careful to keep the project lean and simple: both to use and to modify. Optional features should not make the user experience more complex. Instead, documentation on how to add the feature is preferred.
