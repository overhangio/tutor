Constants
=========

Here we lists named :ref:`actions`, :ref:`filters` and :ref:`contexts` that are used across Tutor. These are simply hook variables that we can refer to across the Tutor codebase without having to hard-code string names. The API is slightly different and less verbose than "native" hooks.

Actions

.. autoclass:: tutor.hooks.Actions
    :members:

Filters
=======

.. autoclass:: tutor.hooks.Filters
    :members:

Contexts
