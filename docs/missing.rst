Missing features
================

- `discovery service <https://github.com/edx/course-discovery/>`_
- `ecommerce <https://github.com/edx/ecommerce>`_
- `analytics <https://github.com/edx/edx-analytics-pipeline>`_

Those extra services were considered low priority while developing this project. However, most of them should not be too hard to add to a standard install. If you need one or more of these services, feel free to let me know by opening an issue.
