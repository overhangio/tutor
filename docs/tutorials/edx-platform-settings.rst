Modifying ``edx-platform`` settings
-----------------------------------

The default settings module loaded by ``edx-platform`` is ``tutor.production`` in production and ``tutor.development`` in development. The folders ``$(tutor config printroot)/env/apps/openedx/settings/lms`` and ``$(tutor config printroot)/env/apps/openedx/settings/cms`` are mounted as ``edx-platform/lms/envs/tutor`` and ``edx-platform/cms/envs/tutor`` inside the docker containers. Thus, to use your own settings, you must do two things:

1. Copy your settings files for the lms and the cms to ``$(tutor config printroot)/env/apps/openedx/settings/lms/mysettings.py`` and ``$(tutor config printroot)/env/apps/openedx/settings/cms/mysettings.py``.
2. Load your settings by adding ``TUTOR_EDX_PLATFORM_SETTINGS=tutor.mysettings`` to ``$(tutor config printroot)/env/local/.env``.

Of course, your settings should be compatible with the docker installation. You can get some inspiration from the ``production.py`` settings modules generated by Tutor, or just import it as a base by adding ``from .production import *`` at the top of ``mysettings.py``.
