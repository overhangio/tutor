    Contexts are used to track in which parts of the code filters and actions have been
    declared. Let's look at an example::

        from tutor.core.hooks import contexts

        with contexts.enter("c1"):
            @filters.add("f1")
            def add_stuff_to_filter(...):
                ...

    The fact that our custom filter was added in a certain context allows us to later
    remove it. To do so, we write::

        from tutor import hooks
        filters.clear("f1", context="c1")

    For instance, contexts make it easy to disable side-effects by plugins, provided
    they were created with a specific context.

    Identify created hooks with one or multiple context strings.

    Usage::

        from tutor.core import hooks

        with hooks.contexts.enter("my-context"):
            # declare new actions and filters
            ...

        # disabled with:
        hooks.actions.clear_all(context="my-context")
        hooks.filters.clear_all(context="my-context")

    This is a context manager that will attach a context name to all hook callbacks
    created within its scope. The purpose of contexts is to solve an issue that
    is inherent to pluggable hooks: it is difficult to track in which part of the
    code each hook callback was created. This makes things hard to debug when a single
    hook callback goes wrong. It also makes it impossible to disable some hook callbacks after
    they have been created.

    We resolve this issue by storing the current contexts in a static list.
    Whenever a hook is created, the list of current contexts is copied as a
    ``contexts`` attribute. This attribute can be later examined, either for
    removal or for limiting the set of hook callbacks that should be applied.
