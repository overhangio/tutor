class Actions:

    This class is a container for all actions used across Tutor (see
    :py:class:`tutor.core.hooks.Action`). Actions are used to trigger callback functions at
    specific moments in the Tutor life cycle.

    To create a new callback for an existing action, start by importing the hooks
    module::

        from tutor import hooks

    Then create your callback function and decorate it with the :py:meth:`add <tutor.core.hooks.Action.add>` method of the
    action you're interested in::

        @hooks.Actions.SOME_ACTION.add()
        def your_action():

    Your callback function should have the same signature as the original action. For
    instance, to add a callback to the :py:data:`COMPOSE_PROJECT_STARTED` action::

        @hooks.Actions.COMPOSE_PROJECT_STARTED.add():
        def run_this_on_start(root, config, name):
            print(root, config["LMS_HOST", name])

    Your callback function will then be called whenever the ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_STARTED.do`` method
    is called, i.e: when ``tutor local start`` or ``tutor dev start`` is run.

    Note that action callbacks do not return anything.

    For more information about how actions work, check out the :py:class:`tutor.core.hooks.Action` API.

class Filters:
    """
    Here are the names of all filters used across Tutor. (see
    :py:class:`tutor.core.hooks.Filter`) Filters are used to modify some data at
    specific points during the Tutor life cycle.

    To add a callback to an existing filter, start by importing the hooks module::

        from tutor import hooks

    Then create your callback function and decorate it with :py:meth:`add
    <tutor.core.hooks.Filter.add>` method of the filter instance you need::

            ...

    Note that your filter callback should have the same signature as the original
    filter. The return value should also have the same type as the first argument of the
    callback function.

    Many filters have a list of items as the first argument. Quite often, plugin
    developers just want to add a new item at the end of that list. In such cases there
    is no need for a callback function. Instead, you can use the ``add_item`` method. For
    instance, you can add a "hello" to the init task of the lms container by modifying
    the :py:data:`CLI_DO_INIT_TASKS` filter::

        hooks.Filters.CLI_DO_INIT_TASKS.add_item(("lms", "echo hello"))

    To add multiple items at a time, use ``add_items``::

        hooks.Filters.CLI_DO_INIT_TASKS.add_items(
            ("lms", "echo 'hello from lms'"),
            ("cms", "echo 'hello from cms'"),
        )

    The ``echo`` commands will then be run every time the "init" tasks are run, for
    instance during ``tutor local launch``.

    #: - ``common_domain``: Return the longest common name between two domain names. Example: ``{{ "studio.demo.myopenedx.com"|common_domain("lms.demo.myopenedx.com") }}`` is equal to "demo.myopenedx.com".
    #: - ``encrypt``: Encrypt an arbitrary string. The encryption process is compatible with `htpasswd <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html>`__ verification.
    #: - ``list_if``: In a list of ``(value, condition)`` tuples, return the list of ``value`` for which the ``condition`` is true.
    #: - ``long_to_base64``: Base-64 encode a long integer.
    #: - ``iter_values_named``: Yield the values of the configuration settings that match a certain pattern. Example: ``{% for value in iter_values_named(prefix="KEY", suffix="SUFFIX")%}...{% endfor %}``. By default, only non-empty values are yielded. To iterate also on empty values, pass the ``allow_empty=True`` argument.
    #: - ``patch``: See :ref:`patches <v0_plugin_patches>`.
    #: - ``random_string``: Return a random string of the given length composed of ASCII letters and digits. Example: ``{{ 8|random_string }}``.
    #: - ``reverse_host``: Reverse a domain name (see `reference <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation>`__). Example: ``{{ "demo.myopenedx.com"|reverse_host }}`` is equal to "com.myopenedx.demo".
    #: - ``rsa_import_key``: Import a PEM-formatted RSA key and return the corresponding object.
    #: - ``rsa_private_key``: Export an RSA private key in PEM format.
    #: - ``walk_templates``: Iterate recursively over the templates of the given folder. For instance::
    #:
    #:     {% for file in "apps/myplugin"|walk_templates %}
    #:     ...
    #:     {% endfor %}

    #: - ``TUTOR_APP``: the app name ("tutor" by default), used to determine the dev/local project names.
    #: - ``TUTOR_VERSION``: the current version of Tutor.
    #: - ``is_buildkit_enabled``: a boolean function that indicates whether BuildKit is available on the host.
    #: - ``iter_values_named``: a function to iterate on variables that start or end with a given string.
    #: - ``iter_mounts``: a function that yields compose-compatible bind-mounts for any given service.
    #: - ``patch``: a function to incorporate extra content into a template.

    #: :parameter filters: list of (name, value) tuples.
    ENV_TEMPLATE_VARIABLES: Filter[list[tuple[str, Any]], []] = Filter()

    #: List of images to be built when we run ``tutor images build ...``.

    #: :parameter list[tuple[str, tuple[str, ...], str, tuple[str, ...]]] tasks: list of ``(name, path, tag, args)`` tuples.
    #:
    #:    - ``name`` is the name of the image, as in ``tutor images build myimage``.
    #:    - ``path`` is the relative path to the folder that contains the Dockerfile. This can be either a string or a tuple of strings.
    #:      For instance ``("myplugin", "build", "myservice")`` indicates that the template will be read from
    #:      ``myplugin/build/myservice/Dockerfile``. This argument value would be equivalent to "myplugin/build/myservice".
    #:    - ``tag`` is the Docker tag that will be applied to the image. It will be
    #:      rendered at runtime with the user configuration. Thus, the image tag could
    #:      be ``"{{ DOCKER_REGISTRY }}/myimage:{{ TUTOR_VERSION }}"``.

    #: List of host directories to be automatically bind-mounted in Docker images at
    #: build time. For instance, this is useful to build Docker images using a custom
    #: repository on the host.
    #:
    #: This filter works similarly to the :py:data:`COMPOSE_MOUNTS` filter, with a few differences.
    #:
    #: :parameter list[tuple[str, str]] mounts: each item is a pair of ``(name, value)``

    #:   documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#build-context>`__.
    #:   The following option will be added to the ``docker buildx build`` command:
    #:   ``--build-context={name}={value}``. If the Dockerfile contains a "name" stage, then
    #:   that stage will be replaced by the corresponding directory on the host.
    #: :parameter str name: full path to the host-mounted folder. As opposed to
    #:   :py:data:`COMPOSE_MOUNTS`, this is not just the basename, but the full path. When
    #:   implementing this filter you should check this path (for instance: with
