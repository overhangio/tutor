    #: Many ``tutor local`` and ``tutor dev`` commands support ``--mounts`` options

    #: /openedx/edx-platform location. Plugin developers may implement this filter to
    #: define custom behaviour when mounting folders that relate to their plugins. For

    #: option.

    #:   the ``path`` because it will fail on Windows.

    #: This filter is not so convenient and plugin developers will probably
    #: prefer :py:data:`ENV_PATCHES`.

    #: - ``__pycache__`` directories and ``*.pyc`` files
    #: - "partials" directories.
    #:

    #: List of template source/destination targets.
    #:
    #: :parameter list[tuple[str, str]] targets: list of (source, destination) pairs.
    #:   Each source is a path relative to one of the template roots, and each destination
    #:   is a path relative to the environment root. For instance: adding ``("c/d",
    #:   "a/b")`` to the filter will cause all files from "c/d" to be rendered to the ``a/b/c/d``
    #:   subfolder.
    ENV_TEMPLATE_TARGETS = filters.get("env:templates:targets")

    #: List of `Jinja2 filters <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/templates/#filters>`__ that will be
    #: available in templates. Jinja2 filters are basically functions that can be used
    #: as follows within templates::
    #:
    #:    {{ "somevalue"|my_filter }}
    #:
    #: Note that Jinja2 filters are a completely different thing than the Tutor hook
    #: filters, although they share the same name.
    #:
    #: Out of the box, Tutor comes with the following filters:
    #:
    #: - ``common_domain``: Return the longest common name between two domain names. Example: ``{{ "studio.demo.myopenedx.com"|common_domain("lms.demo.myopenedx.com") }}`` is equal to "demo.myopenedx.com".
    #: - ``encrypt``: Encrypt an arbitrary string. The encryption process is compatible with `htpasswd <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html>`__ verification.
    #: - ``list_if``: In a list of ``(value, condition)`` tuples, return the list of ``value`` for which the ``condition`` is true.
    #: - ``long_to_base64``: Base-64 encode a long integer.
    #: - ``iter_values_named``: Yield the values of the configuration settings that match a certain pattern. Example: ``{% for value in iter_values_named(prefix="KEY", suffix="SUFFIX")%}...{% endfor %}``. By default, only non-empty values are yielded. To iterate also on empty values, pass the ``allow_empty=True`` argument.
    #: - ``patch``: See :ref:`patches <v0_plugin_patches>`.
    #: - ``random_string``: Return a random string of the given length composed of ASCII letters and digits. Example: ``{{ 8|random_string }}``.
    #: - ``reverse_host``: Reverse a domain name (see `reference <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation>`__). Example: ``{{ "demo.myopenedx.com"|reverse_host }}`` is equal to "com.myopenedx.demo".
    #: - ``rsa_import_key``: Import a PEM-formatted RSA key and return the corresponding object.
    #: - ``rsa_private_key``: Export an RSA private key in PEM format.
    #: - ``walk_templates``: Iterate recursively over the templates of the given folder. For instance::
    #:
    #:     {% for file in "apps/myplugin"|walk_templates %}
    #:     ...
    #:     {% endfor %}
    #:
    #: :parameter filters: list of (name, function) tuples. The function signature
    #:   should correspond to its usage in templates.

    #: List of extra variables to be included in all templates.
    #:
    #: :parameter filters: list of (name, value) tuples.
    ENV_TEMPLATE_VARIABLES = filters.get("env:templates:variables")

    #: List of installed plugins. In order to be added to this list, a plugin must first
    #: be discovered (see :py:data:`Actions.CORE_READY`).

class Contexts:
    """
    Contexts are used to track in which parts of the code filters and actions have been

            @filters.add("f1") def add_stuff_to_filter(...):

    The fact that our custom filter was added in a certain context allows us to later
    remove it. To do so, we write::

        from tutor import hooks
        filters.clear("f1", context="c1")

    This makes it easy to disable side-effects by plugins, provided they were created with appropriate contexts.

    Here we list all the contexts that are used across Tutor. It is not expected that
    plugin developers will ever need to use contexts. But if you do, this is how it
    should be done::

        from tutor import hooks

        with hooks.Contexts.MY_CONTEXT.enter():
            # do stuff and all created hooks will include MY_CONTEXT

        # Apply only the hook callbacks that were created within MY_CONTEXT
