# The initialization job contains various re-install operations needed to be done
# on mounted directories (edx-platform, /mnt/*xblock, /mnt/<edx-ora, search, enterprise>)
# 1. /mnt/*
# Whenever xblocks or other installable packages are mounted, during the image build, they are copied over to container
# and installed. This results in egg_info generation for the mounted directories. However, the egg_info is not carried
# over to host. When the containers are launched, the host directories without egg_info are mounted on runtime
# and disappear from pip list.
#
# 2. edx-platform
# When a new local copy of edx-platform is bind-mounted, certain build
# artifacts from the openedx image's edx-platform directory are lost.
# We regenerate them here.
